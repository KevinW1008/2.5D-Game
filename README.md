## Objectives:
- This project is designed around utilizing our two different backgrounds on a shared interest: game design! Using the concept of Paper 2.5D, we are using original and public assets to create characters, environments, and events. We are learning Unreal Engine and new Game Design concepts (in particular to Paper 2.5) to build this mini game, utilizing Unreal's blueprints to code actors and in game events/physics.
